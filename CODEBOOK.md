Codebook:
Subject: 30 subjects are identified by numbers from 1-30
Activity: 6 possible activities were undertaken as part of the study including 
Walking, Walking upstairs, Walking downstairs, Sitting, Standing and Laying

All measurements were done along X, Y and Z axes from a gyroscope and an accelerometer.
All measurements were also normalized and bounded by [-1, 1]. Before this, accelerometer 
measurements were computed in g's, and gyroscope measurements were computed in
radians/second.

Magnitudes were computed using the Euclidean Norm. Measurements with Jerk were computed 
from linear acceleration and angular velocity. Frequency Domain measurements were computed
with by applying an FFT to some signals.
